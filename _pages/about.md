Hello! I'm Alyssa Mariel, a skilled and versatile Full Stack Web Developer with 2 years of professional experience. Throughout my journey, I have honed my expertise in a wide range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, ReactJS, Wordpress, Java, Angular, C#, .NET, and TypeScript.

In addition to my technical proficiency, I possess knowledge in WordPress and SEO, enabling me to create impactful and optimized websites. Furthermore, I have developed a flair for multimedia editing and am adept at utilizing Adobe Creative Cloud for photo and video edits.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
